This ReadMe serves to document progress on the IST 261 project as it is built upon.
Updates will be split into their relative section headers as listed on Canvas.

==== Module 01: Project Proposal ====
// link_to project proposal
[Project Proposal](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B66X1gId2oGROXlfSXYzRkhuTkE/view?usp=sharing)

    Created Project Proposal,
    Idea is to crate an application that will read in data from a text file (or
    multiple), which will populate data to allow a 'Phone Finder' application.
    This is supposed to help the user when shopping for phone by comparing 
    different phones that are offered at different carriers so that they can 
    find the cheapest phone with a plan that will suit their needs.

    [Possible Extra Ideas]
        * Populate the text field based on gathering data from the Internet.
        * Convert to web application.

====  Module 02: Identify and Design Model Classes ====
[CRC Cards](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B66X1gId2oGROVlvV0hTb2IxUEk/view?usp=sharing)

    Identified 5 Java classes for the project.
        1. Phone
        2. Carrier
        3. Plan
        4. Option
        5. Feature

    These classes are the base ones identified so far to lay the ground work for
    the project and allowed for work to begin writing functions for each class
    once it was identified what they would be handling.

====  Module 03: Writing Tests for Model Classes ====
